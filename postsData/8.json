{"id":8,"title":"Assertions","contents":"One recommended way to verify errors in your program before release, be it by invaled parameters being passed, unexpected values being changed, or anything else it is a good Idea to use ***Assertions***. They are made so we can catch errors and fix them before release working code.\n\nOne way to use them are setting a **precondition**: a condition that must be true pior to code execution:\n```cpp\nvoid printDivision(int x, int y){\n\tif (y == 0){\n\t\tstd::cerr << \"Error: Could not divide by zero\\n\";\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\tstd::cout << static_cast<double>(x) / y;\n}\n```"}
